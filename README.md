## What does what
- `app.js` is where the program start running. It creates a window and loads `index.html` into it.
- `index.html` adds a canvas that can be drawn to and some basic html structure around it. It then loads `index.js`
- `index.js` is where all the magic happens. This is where all the drawing code is.
